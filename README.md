### Prerequisites

Participants are expected to have good programming skills, basic knowledge of web programming and databases, and know the basics of the Git version control system. You are also expected to have perseverance and a capacity for solving problems and seeking information independently.

Previous knowledge of JavaScript or other course topics is not required.

How much programming experience is needed? It is hard to say, but you should be pretty fluent with  _your_  language. This level of fluency takes usually at least 100-200 hours of practice to develop.
